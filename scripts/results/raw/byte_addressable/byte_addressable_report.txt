Byte-Addressable I/O Test Report
================================

Test Configuration:
- Device: /dev/nvme1n1
- Filesystem: ext4
- I/O Method: Buffer I/O with fdatasync
- Iterations per size: 10000

Results Summary:

Size (B) | IOPS    | Latency (us) | Bandwidth (KB/s)
---------|---------|--------------|------------------

Analysis:
- Sub-512B writes require filesystem buffer I/O on traditional NVMe SSDs
- Each write followed by fdatasync ensures data persistence
- CXL SSDs with byte-addressable capability can handle these operations natively
- Performance degradation visible for very small I/O sizes due to overhead

Note: Traditional NVMe SSDs have 512B minimum sector size limitation.
CXL SSDs support true byte-addressable operations without this restriction.
